Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.

I'm still exploring this template too. Feel free to contact me if you got any problems or questions and we can discuss them together.


# Getting Started(Simplified Version)

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

See more info at https://academicpages.github.io/. Or more detailed instructios from this personal blog https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/. Fun fact: he also used the template from Academic Pages to build his blog.

## Some tips

1. Usually github only allows 1 github page, so make sure that your repo name is the same as your github username, or there may be conflicts. 
1. You don't necessarily need to run locally and do the setup if you feel it's too much, or also a beginner like me.
1. For how to make your own modifications, check this https://archive.is/3TPas. Although some of the instructions are out of dated, you can still easily get the logic.

Good luck! And I wish you the best in your academic journey.
